# python-api-challenge
This challenge utilizes Python requests, APIs, JSON, and hvplot skills to answer key questios about weather patterns and vacation planning. 

### WeatherPY
In **WeatherPY**, I analyzed weather data for over 500 cities using Python's requests, OpenWeatherMap API, and citipy to generate random locations.  The goal was to visualize the relationship between latitude and various weather variable, such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.  

### VacationPY
In **VacationPy**, I used the weather data from **WeatherPy** to identify and map ideal vacation destinations based on specific weather conditions.  Then I used the Geoapify API to located hotels within 10,000 meters of the selected cities and created an interactive map with hover over functionality. 

### Key Technologies and Tools
-**Python Libraries:** requests, pandas, matplotlib, and hvplot.

-**APIs:** OpenWeatherMap API and Geoapify API

-**citipy:** for mapping random coordinates to the nearest city

### Resources:
for WeatherPy code:  During my tutor session, Angel helped with with the code to create the function for linear regression plots, add the units metrics to my url and helped me with the city url.
